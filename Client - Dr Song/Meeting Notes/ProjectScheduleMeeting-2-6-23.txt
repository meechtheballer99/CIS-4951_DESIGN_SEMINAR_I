*add senior design comp date to project file (find this date!)
*have team leader
*divide tasks among everyone (resource managmenet)
-drone operator
-car operator
-communication interface operator (image compression and trans between drone and car)
-2 people to handle Open CV 
*TRY to make/win competition! --> demo: detect object and stop the car (no optimization yet)
	-drone follows car, stops car when sees signal (like red tape/block)
*then next semester focus on testing/optimization algorithms
